# Introduction
Accurate pathological grading is vital for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is expected to focus on the tumor region. However, existing relational multi-instance learning (MIL) approaches overly learn nontumor instances, resulting in inaccurate SCC pathology grading. Inspired by this critical issue, this study proposes an end-to-end tumor priori knowledge-guided instance clustering-driving multi-instance learning, i.e., TicMIL, with three fold ideas: first, we develop an end-to-end instance inhibition parallel learning algorithm that is able to build the precise feature representations for non-equilibrium learning of tumor and nontumor instances; second, we incorporate the tumor priori knowledge-guiding instance clustering into the network for addressing the fuzzy labeling of cluster centers, as well as enhancing the modelâ€™s representation ability to the tumor instances; third, we prove that model the imbalance between tumor and nontumor instances into the relational MIL, thus decreasing the decision entropy value of model for enlarging the learning margin to obtain high grading accraucy. We employ extensive experiments on two SCC datasets, i.e., AMU-CSCC and AMU-LSCC, which show that the TicMIL outperforms other MIL SOTAs. It is able to represent the SCC pathology grading patterns with high accuracy, proving its potential for clinical utility.
